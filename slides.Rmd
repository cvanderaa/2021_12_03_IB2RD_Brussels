### Concept

Single-cell proteomics is part of the single-cell technologies that are
incredibly powerful when it comes to studying cellular heterogeneity.

The great advantage of single-cell on bulk assays is that they are able
to discover unknown sub-populations, even in well studied tissues. 
Furthermore, single-cell assays capture continuous profiles typical of
differentiation processes. 

Let me show you an example.

### Example

In this study by Wang et al., the authors applied scRNA-Seq on 
embryonic liver. They were able for instance to identify a new 
sub-population of hepatoblasts expressing ID3 that was never described
before. In the same study, they also could reconstruct the hematopoietic
lineage from progenitors that differentiate into neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, dendritic cells,...

But this presentation is about single-cell proteomics, not scRNA-Seq.
So you may ask yourself: why should we bother with proteins?

#### Proteins are more abundant than RNA

Theoretically, counting RNA copies is more subject to stochasticity
than counting protein copies. 

**Challenge**: improve technology to increase sensitivity and accuracy

#### Protein measurements are computed from multiple peptides 

Estimate protein abundance **AND** variance

**Challenge**: improve computational mapping of peptides to proteins

### Concept

Well, let us keep this in mind: RNA represent the intention of a cell.
A cell may or may not commit to it. It is a precursor that is "only"
used as a proxy to infer protein abundance. Protein allows for function.
If the cell would want to rub its face, it would probably build a 
protein for it! Hence the protein content will determine the cell's 
identity. 

But can't we simply say that RNA is equal to protein? No we cannot!

### Correlation

...

Ok it is not the same, but at least RNA at single-cell is much easier
to measure. Yes, for the moment, but something important to 
keep in mind is that scRNA-Seq is possible thanks to PCR amplification.
